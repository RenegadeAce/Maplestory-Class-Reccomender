# Maplestory-Class-Recommender
An open source Maplestory class recommendation system desinged to help new, old, and returning players find the class that's right for them.

Hello! Welcome to the Maplestory Class Recommender Github. This will be the source and primary location for all files and artifiacts related to this project. As you can see there's not much here yet becuase I just got started, but my goal is to have a model deployed and available to the public in the next few weeks. In order to achieve that goal I need the help of the Maplestory community. To build and train a recommendation system I need data that describes a wide varaity of players' experiences with each class. To collect this information I've set up a google survey that can be found here:https://forms.gle/xjc9Kcn7KhML6ikZ8. 

If you would like to contribute to the project please take a few min to fill out the survey.
